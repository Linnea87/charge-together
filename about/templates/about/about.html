                    <p class="card-text">When Our daughter was born with CHARGE syndrome,
                         ur world changed. 
                        <br>Navigating the medical complexities, daily challenges, 
                        and emotional rollercoaster <br> was overwhelming. 
                        I realized that while medical information 
                        is vital, <br>it is the personal stories and shared experiences 
                        that truly help families cope and thrive. <br>
                        I found myself desperately seeking the experiences 
                        and stories of others <br> who were on a similar journey
                        I longed for the comfort and guidance that only personal stories can provide,
                        <br>but struggled to find a community where these narratives were shared. <br>
                        This profound need for connection and understanding inspired me to start this blog. <br>
                        And this is my way of creating the community and resource I wished I had when my daughter was born. <br>
                        It is a place for us to come together, share our experiences, and support one another <br>
                        through the unique journey of living with CHARGE syndrome. <br><br>
                        Thank you for being a part of this community. <br>
                        All my love <br> Linn√©a
