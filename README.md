## Security
### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

- Implementing CSRF protection helps prevent malicious websites from executing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- Django provides built-in CSRF protection by including a CSRF token with each form submission and verifying it on the server side.

### Django Allauth for Authentication and Authorization

- Django Allauth is an authentication and authorization framework that provides features like registration, login, password management, and social authentication.
- It ensures secure user authentication and authorization processes.

### Restricted Features for Authenticated Users

- Certain features, such as creating, editing, or deleting blog posts and profiles, are reserved for authenticated users only.
- By requiring users to be logged in to access these features, the application enhances security and ensures that sensitive operations are performed by authorized individuals only.

## Languages/Technolgies
This Project is built using various technologies.

- **Django 5.0.6:** A Python web framework for building web applications.
- **Bootstrap 5.2.3:** A front-end framework for responsive and visually appealing design.
- **ElephantSQL:** An open-source relational database for data storage.
- **Cloudinary:** Cloud-based storage for the users uploaded images.
- **Heroku:** The platform where the project is deployed.
- **Git and GitHub:** Version control and code repository management.
- **IDE:** Vs Code (Visual Studio Code).

Added libraries can be seen in the requirements.txt file. 
Additionally, custom- python, html, django templating language, and css were all used. 
The README was written using markdown.

## Deployment

- I set up a postgreSQL server at [ElephantSQL.](https://www.elephantsql.com) 
- I made sure to adjust the settings file accordingly, to utilize that database.
- I also made sure to have my SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL in the env.py file.
- And made sute to add the env.py file to .gitignore.
- I installed gunicorn version 20.1.0, and added it to the requirements.txt.
- I installed whitenoise version 5.3.0 and added it to the requirements.txt. I also added it to middleware settings file.
- I also created  a path for whitenoise to collect static files in the settings file.
- I Created a Procfile, and declared it as a web process followed by the command to execute the project.
- Added a runtime.txt file to root directory, and added a supported python version as close as possible to my own.
- I run the command collectstatic, to collect static files.
- In the settings file I set **DEBUG = os.environ.get("DEVELOPMENT")** and in env.py I added; **os.environ.setdefault('DEVELOPMENT', 'True')**, so i donÂ´t have to remember to change debug to *False* everytime I deploy to Heroku.
- I added Heroku to allowed hosts in the settings file (.herokuapp). Then I Pushed the code to GitHub.
- I went to [Heroku](https://.heroku.com) and created a new app.
- On the settings tab of my app I clicked "Reveal Config Vars" and added DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY.
- The DATABASE_URL got the value of my postgresql database url, and the SECRET_KEY got a complicated value that i made up of my own.
- Then I went back to the deploy tab of my app, and clicked connect to GitHub.
- I then searched for my repository and connected it to the app, and clicked Deploy branch

### Solved Bugs
In my view, I had only linked comments to the blog post itself. I fixed the bug by also linking the comment to the user.
